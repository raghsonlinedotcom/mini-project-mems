# Github Assignments

1. `https://github.com/raghsonlinedotcom/mini-project-mems/tree/test-branch` pls accept the invite you would have got from GitHub to my raghsonlinedotcom repository, and then checkout and check in the code with some dummy files (test-rama.txt, etc.,) inside a folder named test (if it does not exist, create one) and push to this branch. I would get a request for the PR to be merged. which I will do once I come to office tomorrow.

2. Also, pls take the latest with git pull from the Remote main branch and deploy it in your local Tomcat and also open it as a new project in your Eclipse - by copying the source code to a new location (Development Environment).. there is no .war file .. you get the complete source in GitHub..
